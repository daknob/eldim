# API Documentation

eldim exposes an HTTP API for all servers to upload data. Here you can find
all the currently supported calls to this API:

## GET /
By sending a `GET` request to `/`, eldim will either print some information
about it, or nothing, depending on the value of `servertokens` in the
configuration file.

## POST /api/v1/file/upload/
By sending a `POST` request to `/api/v1/file/upload/`, you can upload files
to eldim. Currently there are two parameters that are required:

### filename
This is of type `string`, and must contain the desired name of the file.
This can be anything, but spaces or symbols that are not normal for files
are not recommended, since they may not be supported by the backends.

### file
This `POST` parameter is the actual file. Send the entire file here that has
to be uploaded here.

This API call will return `HTTP 200` and print `Ok` if the upload succeeded.
Any other HTTP Status Code or message is an error.

### password
This `POST` parameter is a string that specifies a password, which will be
checked against `eldim`'s `clients.yml` and will identify hosts based on their
password key, instead of their IP Address. Password checks take precedence over
IP Address checks. The password must be between 32 and 128 characters for
security reasons.
